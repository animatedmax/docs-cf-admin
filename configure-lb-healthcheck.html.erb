## Configuring Load Balancer Healthchecks for CF Routers

The following are the default healthcheck endpoints that are available for haproxy, gorouter, and tcp_router:
  * `http://haproxy_IP:8080/health` (This is the HAProxy deployed with CF-Release)
  * `http://gorouter_IP:8080/health`
  * `http://tcp_router_IP:80/health`

For gorouter the healthcheck port is configurable with the cf-release deployment manifest
property `router.status.port` in cf-release.

For tcp_router the healthcheck port is configurable with the routing-release deployment manifest
property `haproxy.health_check_port`. This property will not affect the healthcheck of the HAProxy deployed with CF-Release.

In your load balancer backend health configuration,
be sure to add the running instances of your selected type of router,
set their corresponding ports, and set the request paths as `/health`.
